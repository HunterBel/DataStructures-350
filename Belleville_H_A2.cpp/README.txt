I tried to leave my code stems for what I wanted to do with the code, at a point mario was moveing a couple times then
the segmentation fault was occuring, through fiddling and what not I ended up making a worse output that no longer moves mario. 
I am unsure why the recursive move() method isnt working how I want it too. Unfortunatly I wasnt able to finish the code. 
If i got movement to work I would have implemented all of the interactable methods. But mario doenst want to move i suppose
If i did get him to move and interact in my level class I would have had a loop that checked if he had lives and if the 
keepGoing() method was good, this keepGoing method would have checked to see if he had traversed all the level or something
to make sure that the program would stop when he wins or loses. That is basically all of my code and thoughts.
